### Conceptual Exercise

Answer the following questions below:

- What is a JWT?
- A JWT is a way to transmit information as a JSON object. It is commonly used for authentication and information exchange between web applications.

- What is the signature portion of the JWT?  What does it do?
- The signature is the third part after the two dots. It is used to verify the token was issued by a trusted third party. 

- If a JWT is intercepted, can the attacker see what's inside the payload?
- Yes, the attacker can see what's inside the payload, but not modify it without the key used to create the signature.

- How can you implement authentication with a JWT?  Describe how it works at a high level.
- The server issues a JWT to a client upon successful login. The client then includes this JWT in future requests to the server. The server then verifies the JWT and extracts user information from the payload to authenticate and authorize the client.

- Compare and contrast unit, integration and end-to-end tests.
- Unit tests focus on testing individual components or functions in isolation. Integration tests check how multiple components work together. End-to-end tests simulate real user scenarios across the entire platform.

- What is a mock? What are some things you would mock?
- A mock is a simulated object used for testing. APIs, databases, and services are good to be mocked to isolate the code being tested.

- What is continuous integration?
- CI is a practice where developers regularly merge their code into a central repository where automated tests are run.

- What is an environment variable and what are they used for?
- A dynamic-named value that can affect the behavior of running processes. They are used to store configuration setting, credentials, or systems parameters that can vary between environments.

- What is TDD? What are some benefits and drawbacks?
- TDD is when developers write tests before the actual code. This leads to better code quality, design clarity, and more confidence in refactoring. Some problems would be an increase in initial time investment and potential over-specification of code.

- What is the value of using JSONSchema for validation?
- Using JSONSchema provides a standardized way to define the structure of JSON data. It ensures data consistency, improves documemntation, and helps in communicating data requirements. 

- What are some ways to decide which code to test?
- You can prioritize specific areas in your code to go for first. Testing code that has dependencies or interactions with external systems is also recommended.

- What does `RETURNING` do in SQL? When would you use it?
- `RETURNING` is a clause in SQL that returns values generated by data manipulation statements. It is used to retrieve the values of columns affected by these statements. 

- What are some differences between Web Sockets and HTTP?
- Web Sockets provide full-duplex communication channels over a single, long-lived connection, suitable for real-time applications. HTTP, on the other hand, follows a request-response model and is stateless by default, suitable for traditional web applications.

- Did you prefer using Flask over Express? Why or why not (there is no right
  answer here --- we want to see how you think about technology)?
  So far, I prefer using Flask over Express. I believe it is solely due to the amount of experience I have with Flask as opposed to Express. Beyond that, I enjoy how simple and flexible Flask is.
